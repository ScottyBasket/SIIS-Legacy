            <h2>
                Slay the wicked
            </h2>
            <p>
                “Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by
                testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceplable and perfect"
                -Romans 12:2
                <br>
                <br>
                We strive to push past boy hood immaturity towards spiritual manliness. No longer do we
                tolerate wicked behavior in our own lives or allow the members of this floor to be passive
                amidst sinful tendencies. Together, we will fight against temptations of lust, apathy,
                cynicism, and ungodliness. In this wav. we will be transformed into holy servants of Christ.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Girls are dumb, but women of God are awesome

                “Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised."
                -Proverbs 31:30
                <br>
                <br>
                We seek to exemplify spiritual maturity in our relationships with women. Firstly, the women
                that we make priorities in our lives should be honorable and holy, and they should love
                Christ more than thev like us. Secondly, although spending time with women of Christ 1s
                good, each one of us should remain sturdy in our commitment to the community of this foor.
            </p>
            <h2>
                There is always room for one more

                “Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another.
                Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight
                -Romans 12.15-16
                <br>
                <br>
                We commit ourselves to creating and maintaining unity that extends over the entire floor.
                Community without intentional inclusivity is bound to dissolve from a unifed group into
                scattered cliques. Therefore, our efforts should not be limited to simply allowing people to join if
                they ask. but we should love each other by actively and intentionally inviting one another
                on a consistent basis.

                “For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same
                function, so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another”
                -Romans 12.4-5
                <br>
                <br>
                We encourage the diversity of gifts, talents, and opinions of each and every member on this floor.
                regardless of age, class, or appearance. No matter why
                each individual will be respected and loved
                who you are, or where you have come from, you have a voice and a role on SammyII.

                Sammy II Sucks (Up Mine)
            </h2>
            <p>
                “Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than
                yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others."
                -Philippians 2.3-4
                <br>
                <br>
                We, as men of Sammy II, work to strip ourselves of a past that once put Sammy II in a
                negative light, and adopt a consciously humble attitude. We as Christians, recognize our own
                failure and sinfulness as human beings, and realize our need for a relationship with God. Due
                to this knowledge, we equip ourselves with zealous humility as we go through our daily lives. All
                in all, we will be last, and we will be bold.
